                        <b>Process: </b>  In February, when I started this position, I was completely unfamiliar with 
                        React. To create a preliminary website for potential investors and users, I tried bringing the vision 
                        of the UI/UX Designers to life by creating a Single Page Website using basic HTML and CSS. I also added
                        Google Analytics to this site to get data on the regions and demographic of our potential investors. Using bootstrap
                        studio, we also successfully made the website responsive for Laptops, Tablets and iPhone.  
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
                        <img src={require('../components/images/infopost/oldInfo1.png')} alt='Old InfoPost' style={oldInfo}/>
                        <img src={require('../components/images/infopost/oldInfo2.png')} alt='Old InfoPost' style={oldInfo}/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        While the old site was running for 4 months, we redesigned our application. In light of this change, 
                        I developed a new website, this time using React. Along with this, I worked on the Web Application for 
                        InfoPost wherein we used React along with it's several libraries to create the Timeline View, Profile View and 
                        Political Information page. Through this experience I was able to get a very hands-on experience with React, as 
                        well as see a startup grow from a single person to a team of ten. Our app is available for download at both &nbsp;
